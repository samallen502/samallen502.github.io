# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
As part of the graduation requirements for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development (FEWD) track, completion of a project* is required.  For my project, I elected to create a professional website, which will serve to market my skills and provide a platform to showcase future projects. The project will be built using a "mobile first" design philosophy and will feature HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank some folks who shared knowledge, making this project possible:

1. https://blog.christopherianmurphy.com/2016/01/responsive-pure-css-menu/ helped me build a responsive mobile-first menu that was intentionally free of JavaScript (as core features should not depend upon JavaScript per the "unobtrusive JavaScript" principle).

## Lessons Learned

1. Patience in troubleshooting and due diligence in testing your website on actual devices -- not just relying on Chrome/Firefox's emulations of mobile devices, for example -- is so necessary.  For a great, actual example of me going through the process, see: https://teamtreehouse.com/community/entire-page-content-shifting-to-right-unsure-why
