# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
As part of the graduation requirements for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development (FEWD) track, completion of a project* is required.  For my project, I elected to create a professional website, which will serve to market my skills and provide a platform to showcase future projects. The project will be built using a "mobile first" design philosophy and will feature HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
